### Overview of Alchemix

Alchemix is DeFi protocol that lets you borrow from a pool and automatically get the loan to repay itself by investing the collateral you deposited into some other yield generating protocols.

Loans taken from Alchemix have a collateralization ratio of up to 200%. This means that the collateral deposited into the protocol must be 200% of the loan to be taken from the protocol. For example, to take a loan worth 50 USDC, the user must deposit a collateral of 100 USDC into the protocol.

  

In Alchemix, loans are minted and paid out in `alUSD`â€‹, a synthetic asset pegged to the US dollar.

There are 3 ways to recover your collateral in Alchemix:

*   Allow the yield obtained from the collateral pay off the loan
    
*   Payoff the loan in alUSD or any supported asset
    
*   Self-liquidate by taking what's left when the debt is deducted from the collateral
    

  

Alchemix takes a 10% fee off the yield generated from the collateral deposited into the pool. This 10% fee is paid to the treasury and to the DAO as revenue for acting rationally in the protocol.

  

The role of Alchemix's ALCX token.

ALCX is a token that grants governance rights in Alchemix DAO. Some of its uses include:

*   It's used to assign voting power to holders for snapshot votes
    
*   It's used as a liquidity mining incentive mechanism
    

Other information about the ALCX token including token distribution, token emission schedule, etc can be found [here](https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/alchemix-finance/token-distribution).

  

**Staking Pools and Yield Farming in Alchemix**

Alchemix staking pools are used to distribute ALCX tokens and to create liquidity (by providing liquidity pairs) for tokens in the Alchemix ecosystem. These pools also serve as farms as they generate yield when assets are staked in them. Here's some detail about some of the pools and their yield earning potentials:

  

ALCX Pool

This pool encourages the holders of ALCX by rewarding them for staking their ALCX in the pool. This pool generates yield by accruing 14.4% of the token emission from the protocol every week and distributes the accrued funds to all stakers based on the proportions of their stake.

  

Sushiswap ALCX/ETH Liquidity Pool

This pool provides the liquidity market for the ALCX governance token through it's ALCX-ETH pair on sushiswap. After providing liquidity to the ALCX-ETH pair to the pool on sushiswap, users can deposit their ALCX-ETH SLP tokens into the ALCX/ETH Sushiswap LP Farm on Alchemix to generate yield. This pool rewards its stakers by accruing 46.4% of the token emission from the protocol every week and distributes the accrued funds to all stakers based on the proportions of their stake.

  

SaddleSwap alETH Liquidity Pool

The saddleswap pool creates a market for alETH against ETH-pegged assets. Users can participate by depositing into the alETH liquidity pool and then stake their LP token in the Saddle alETH farm on Alchemix to earn a stream of ALCX rewards. This farm accrues 4.4% of the token emission fromm the protocol every week and distributes the accrued funds to all stakers based on the proportions of their stake.

  

Tokemak alUSD Pool

The tokemak alUSD pool allows liquidity providers to deposit single-sided asset into individual token reactors to earn yield in TOKE, which is tokemak's native protocol token. In addition to earning TOKE for providing liquidity, liquidity providers also get tAssets (in this case, tALCX). tALCX can be staked on the designated farm on Alchemix to earn a stream of ALCX rewards. At the moment, it is unknown how much is accrued to the tALCX farm during token emissions on the Alchemix protocol.
